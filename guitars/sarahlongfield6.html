    <h2>Standberg Sarah Longfield Standard 6</h2>
        <p>The <strong>Strandberg Sarah Longfield Standard 6</strong> is a recent purchase, made in 2022. It has quickly become my number one guitar, outpacing
        even technically better units such as the Strandberg Original 6 and the Standberg OS7. </p>
        <h3>Pros</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Playability and setup is done perfectly</li>
            <li>Looks great</li>
            <li>Stringjoy 9.5s customs are a joy to play and bend with, with the pickups</li>
            <li>The Polymaths are top notch - sweet, singing neck</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cons</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Satin finish will buff</li>
            <li>Bridge humbucker has less output, sounds less clinical than the BKP BHs, however you don't need that much higher output when paired with the Omega Granophyre</li>
            <li>Unchamberd body means that it is heavier than the flagship models</li>
        </ul>
